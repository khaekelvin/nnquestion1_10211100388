# Neural Network Sales Prediction Model

**Name:** [Your Name]
**Index Number:** [Your Index Number]

## Project Overview
This project implements a neural network from scratch to predict sales based on advertising expenses in different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The model is deployed as a web application using Flask.

## Features
- Custom Neural Network implementation from scratch
- Web interface for sales predictions
- Data preprocessing and visualization utilities
- Complete test suite

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/nnquestion1_[index_number]
cd nnquestion1_[index_number]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Enter advertising expenses to get sales predictions
